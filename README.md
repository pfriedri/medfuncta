## Paper Abstract
Recent research in medical image analysis with deep learning has almost exclusively focused on grid- or voxel-based data representations in combination with convolutional neural networks. 
We challenge this common choice by introducing MedFuncta, a modality-agnostic continuous data representation based on neural fields. 
We demonstrate how to obtain these neural fields in a reasonable amount of time and compute, by exploiting redundancy in medical signals and by applying an efficient meta-learning approach with a context reduction scheme. 
We further address the spectral bias in commonly used SIREN activations, by introducing a $\omega_0$-schedule, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed. 
We validate our proposed approach on a large variety of medical signals of different dimensions and modalities (1D: ECG; 2D: Chest X-Ray, Retinal OCT, Fundus Camera, Dermatoscope, Colon Histopathology, and Cell Microscopy; 3D: Brain MRI, Lung CT) and successfully prove that we can solve relevant downstream tasks on this representation. 
We additionally release a large-scale dataset of > 550 k annotated functional data representations to promote research in this direction.

## Dependencies
We recommend using a [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) environment to install the required dependencies.
You can create and activate such an environment called `medfuncta` by running the following commands:
```sh
mamba env create -f environment.yaml
mamba activate medfuncta
```
## Training (Meta-Learning)
To obtain meta-learned shared model parameters, simply run the following command with the correct `config.yaml`:
```sh
python train.py --config ./configs/experiments/DATATYPE/DATASET_RESOLUTION.yaml
```

## Evaluation (Test-Time Adaptation/ Reconstruction Experiments)
To perform reconstruction experiments (evaluate the representation quality), simply run the following command with the correct `config.yaml`:
```sh
python eval.py --config ./configs/eval/DATATYPE/DATASET_RESOLUTION.yaml
```
## Create a MedFuncta set
To convert a dataset into our MedFuncta representation, simply run the following command with the correct `config.yaml`:
```sh
python fit_NFset.py --config ./configs/fit/DATATYPE/DATASET_RESOLUTION.yaml
```


## Data
To ensure good reproducibility, we trained and evaluated our network on publicly available datasets:
* **MedMNIST**, a large-scale MNIST-like collection of standardized biomedical images. More information is avilable [here](https://medmnist.com/).

* **MIT-BIH Arryhythmia**, a heartbeat classification dataset. We use a preprocessed version that is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat).

* **BRATS 2023: Adult Glioma**, a dataset containing routine clinically-acquired, multi-site multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain tumor patients. We just used the T1-weighted images for training. The data is available [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51514105).

* **LIDC-IDRI**, a dataset containing multi-site, thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer patients. The data is available [here](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1966254).

The provided code works for the following data structure (you might need to adapt the directories in `data/dataset.py`):
```

    └───BraTS-GLI-00000-000
        └───BraTS-GLI-00000-000-seg.nii.gz

    ...
    
└───MIT-BIH
    └───mitbih_test.csv
    └───mitbih_train.csv
    
    ...
```
We provide a script for preprocessing LIDC-IDRI. Simply run the following command with the correct path to the downloaded DICOM files `DICOM_PATH` and the directory you want to store the processed nifti files `NIFTI_PATH`:
```sh
python data/preproc_lidc-idri.py --dicom_dir DICOM_PATH --nifti_dir NIFTI_PATH
```
